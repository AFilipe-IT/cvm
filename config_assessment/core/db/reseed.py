config_assessment/core/db/reseed.py
-----------------------------------
Keep a persistent (volume-mounted) working DB in sync with the image's canonical
DB, WITHOUT wiping plugins the user installed themselves.

The container seeds the working DB from a baked canonical DB on first run, but
never overwrites an existing DB (that would delete user-installed plugins). The
side effect: updates to the built-in knowledge base (e.g. corrected attack-chain
justifications) never reached an existing volume.

This module closes that gap with a versioned, targeted refresh:

  * a `caspar_meta` table records the base-DB version present in the working DB;
  * when the image ships a newer base version, we refresh ONLY the built-in
    targets (their misconfigurations + attack_chains) from the seed DB, and bump
    the recorded version — user-installed targets are left untouched.

Deterministic and idempotent: running it when already up to date is a no-op.

# before it existed never receives it and the target reports "0 rules" forever.

# every install while its 26 rules reached nobody. Verified against the dump by
# tests/test_reseed.py.
