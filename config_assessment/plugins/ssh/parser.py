plugins/ssh/parser.py
----------------------
Parser for OpenSSH server configuration (sshd_config).

SSH syntax is the simplest of the three targets:
  - One directive per line:                 `PermitRootLogin no`
  - Keyword and value separated by whitespace (one or more spaces/tabs);
    the keyword is case-insensitive, the value preserves its case.
  - Comments start with `#`; blank lines are ignored.
  - `Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf` pulls in fragment files (glob),
    resolved recursively relative to the including file's directory. This is
    how modern Ubuntu/Debian ships sshd_config.

Match blocks ARE evaluated, under the worst-case principle, not by simulating
a live connection. A `Match <criteria>` line opens a conditional scope;
directives inside it apply only when the criteria match at connection time.
Rather than modelling live connection state (which would require an active
probe against a real session — out of scope for a static, offline analyser),
we ask a narrower and fully static question: could an unauthenticated remote
attacker ever satisfy this Match's criteria? `User`/`Group`/`Address` criteria
are attacker-controlled or attacker-reachable by construction (an attacker
picks which username to attempt, and can originate from any address unless
the criteria demonstrably restrict to a non-public range) — so a directive
inside such a block is folded into the flat directive list exactly like a
global one, worst case. Criteria that are NOT attacker-controlled (e.g.
`Match Address 10.0.0.0/8` restricting to a private range) mark the block as
inapplicable to a generic remote attacker, and its directives are kept for
visibility (context recorded) but excluded from evaluation. See
`_match_applies_worst_case` for the exact rule.

The parser performs NO CCSS scoring — that is the runtime engine's job. It
returns a flat list of Directive objects (worst-case principle: record
everything an attacker could plausibly trigger).

    `Match <criteria>` is a sequence of `<Keyword> <value>` pairs (User, Group,
    Host, Address, LocalAddress, LocalPort, RDomain). We only special-case
    `Address`/`LocalAddress`, the one criterion that can genuinely be

    unverifiable statically (reverse-DNS Host), so worst case treats it as
