# CVM Security Posture

You are building CVM — Configuration Vulnerability Meter — a security posture platform. This is the management console: a professional security product, not an admin template.

What the product does

CVM measures how secure a system's configuration actually is. It assesses infrastructure across six dimensions (configuration, permissions, network exposure, secrets, patch level, OS hardening), scores each one, and — this is what makes it different — detects attack chains: combinations of individually moderate weaknesses that together create severe risk. A version-disclosure header scores 8.5 alone; combined with a reachable service running an exploitable version, it scores 9.1, because the attacker no longer has to guess.

Users are security engineers and system administrators. They open this console to answer: how exposed am I right now, why, and what do I fix first?

Non-negotiable rules

These are correctness requirements, not style preferences. Getting them wrong makes the product lie to its users.

1. Scores are risk, not health. Higher is worse. 0.0 = nothing found. 10.0 = critical. It is NOT a percentage and NOT a grade. Never render a score as "8.5/10 achieved", never use a progress bar that fills toward 10, never colour a high score green.

Severity bands: 0.0 None (grey) · 0.1–3.9 Low (green) · 4.0–6.9 Medium (yellow) · 7.0–8.9 High (orange) · 9.0–10.0 Critical (red).

2. "Not assessed" is a distinct state from "clean". Three states, never two. Every dimension carries status:

assessed — evaluated, found problems → show score and findings

clean — evaluated, found nothing → score 0.0, explicitly marked clean

not_assessed — never ran → neutral placeholder, dashed border, muted grey, an "Not assessed" label and a short explanation

A not_assessed dimension must NEVER render as 0.0, as green, as a full circle, or as anything a user could read as "fine". In this build configuration, permissions and network exposure are assessed; secrets, patch intelligence and OS hardening are not_assessed — and the dashboard must look honest about that, not broken or empty. This state is a first-class part of the design, so design it properly: it should look deliberate.

3. null deltas are not zero. delta: 0.0 means "unchanged". delta: null means "no comparable previous measurement". Show 0.0 as a neutral "no change" and null as "—" or "first assessment". Never render null as 0.

4. Attack chains are not a list of findings. They are the product's signature feature. A chain must be shown as a composition: its steps in order, what each step contributes (role), and why the combination is worse than the parts. A plain table of chain names wastes the most distinctive thing here.

Data contract

Build against these exact shapes. Use realistic mock data matching them.

A finding:

  "cves": ["CVE-2023-25690"], "in_chains": ["chain-rce-escalation-03"], "status": "open"
}


evidence.kind varies by dimension and the UI shows provenance accordingly: config_file (location + line + snippet) · file_metadata (path + mode + owner) · listening_socket (tcp/0.0.0.0:6379 + process) · package (name + installed_version + fixed_version).

The three assessed dimensions produce visibly different evidence — the detail panel must render each properly, not force all three into a "file + line" layout:

{
  "id": "9d1f4e2c", "dimension": "exposure", "target": "redis", "target_label": "Redis",

}

An attack chain:

  "title": "Version disclosure on an exposed service enables targeted exploitation",
  "score": 9.1, "severity": "Critical", "active": true, "amplification": 1.4,
  "exceeds_overall": true, "cross_dimension": true,
  "narrative": "Apache discloses its exact version, the service answers on every interface, and the running version has a public RCE. An attacker does not need to fingerprint anything — the banner names the exploit to use, and the port is already open.",

    { "order": 2, "finding_id": "3f2b1c9a", "dimension": "configuration", "identifier": "ServerTokens", "score": 8.5, "role": "Reveals the exact version to every client" },
    { "order": 3, "finding_id": "b4e91d70", "dimension": "permissions", "identifier": "/var/www:mode", "score": 6.9, "role": "Web root writable by the service account, turning code execution into persistence" }
  ]
}


A chain spanning all three assessed dimensions is the product's strongest argument — design the chain view so that this reads clearly, with each step visibly tagged by its dimension (icon + colour) so the crossing is obvious at a glance:

{
  "id": "chain-local-escalation-02",
  "title": "World-readable hashes on a host with a permissive sudo policy",
  "score": 8.7, "severity": "High", "active": true, "amplification": 1.2,
  "exceeds_overall": false, "cross_dimension": false,
  "narrative": "Every local account can read the password hashes, and a successful crack lands on an account that can escalate without re-authenticating.",
  "steps": [
    { "order": 1, "finding_id": "5a8c3b7d", "dimension": "permissions", "identifier": "/etc/shadow", "score": 7.8, "role": "Hashes readable by any local user" },
    { "order": 2, "finding_id": "c07a5f31", "dimension": "permissions", "identifier": "sudoers:NOPASSWD", "score": 6.5, "role": "Cracked account escalates without a password prompt" }
  ]
}


Pages

Overview — the main screen. Overall score + what drives it; the six-dimension composition (two assessed, four not); coverage; KPI row (targets, rules evaluated, open findings, critical, attack chains, related CVEs); score over time; top findings; top attack chains; assessed technologies; recent activity. Footer strip with provenance: last assessment time, knowledge base + its sha256 hash, coverage, engine version, scoring model version.

Dimensions — one card per dimension leading to a detail view: score, trend, severity breakdown, its findings. The three assessed ones (Configuration, Identity & Permissions, Network Exposure) are full detail views. The three not_assessed ones show what they would measure and that they haven't run.

Each assessed dimension has its own character and its detail view should reflect it: Configuration is directive-centric (file + line + snippet), Identity & Permissions is filesystem-centric (path, mode, owner, and the chmod/chown that fixes it), Network Exposure is service-centric (listening address, port, bound interface, owning process — and whether the port is reachable beyond localhost). Network Exposure benefits from a compact port/service table as well as a findings list.

Findings — filterable table (dimension, target, severity, has CVE, in chain, free text). Row expands or opens a detail panel with impact, recommendation, evidence with the exact location, CVE references, and which chains it belongs to.

Attack Chains — the showcase page. Each chain rendered as an ordered composition of its steps, with the narrative, the amplification, and clear marking when it's cross_dimension or exceeds_overall.

Targets — the twelve assessed technologies as cards with their brand glyph, score, findings count, benchmark source.

Watch — continuous monitoring: active sessions, live/stale state, events as configuration changes trigger re-assessment, score sparkline.

Reports — generate and export (JSON, SARIF, HTML).

Settings — theme, API, knowledge base info (read-only).

Visual direction

Professional security tooling — the register of Grafana, Snyk, Datadog. Dense with information but calm; a security engineer looks at this for hours. Restrained, not playful. No gradients on cards, no glassmorphism, no decorative illustration.

Light theme is the default and primary. Dark theme must be equally finished — define both as CSS custom properties and switch at token level, never per-component.

Exact palette (light):

--bg: #F6F8FB          background
--panel: #FFFFFF       cards
--panel-alt: #F3F5F9   supporting areas inside a card
--border: #E5E7EB
--text: #111827        --text-muted: #6B7280   --text-faint: #9CA3AF
--accent: #3B82F6      --accent-hover: #2563EB
severity:  none #9CA3AF · low #22C55E · medium #EAB308 · high #F59E0B · critical #EF4444
KPI accents (identity, not severity): blue #3B82F6 · teal #14B8A6 · orange #F97316 · purple #A855F7 · red #EF4444 · amber #F59E0B


Severity colours are reserved for state. Never reuse them as chart series colours — red must mean "critical" everywhere in the console, consistently.

Typography: Inter (or a close geometric sans). Numbers in a tabular-figures font so columns of scores align. Scores are the largest type on the page — they are the product.

Cards: white, 1px --border, ~12px radius, very subtle shadow. Generous internal padding. Section headers small, uppercase, letter-spaced, muted.

Technology icons

Each target has an icon_key mapping to a glyph and its brand colour. Render as a rounded square with the brand colour at ~12% opacity as background and the glyph in full brand colour. In dark mode the glyph colour lightens (given in brackets).

Brand colour is identity, not severity — Redis stays red even when its score is 0. The score next to it carries the state.

Dimension icons (use the accent palette, not severity colours): configuration → sliders · permissions → key/lock · exposure → globe/radio · secrets → eye-off · patch → package · hardening → shield.

Charts

Use Recharts. Thin marks, recessive grids, no 3D, no donut hole filled with decoration.

Overall score: a large radial/arc gauge. It must read as risk — the arc fills toward critical, coloured by severity band, with the numeral dominant.

Dimension composition: horizontal bars, one per dimension, each in its severity colour, with the four not-assessed rows rendered as dashed empty tracks labelled "Not assessed" — not zero-length bars.

Score over time: line chart. If the scoring model version changes mid-series, draw a vertical boundary marker with a label — never connect points computed by different models with an unbroken line.

Severity distribution: donut, severity colours, with counts.

Sparklines in target cards and watch sessions.

Every chart needs a hover tooltip. Charts get a legend when they carry more than one series.

Details that matter

Empty states are designed, not blank: what the section would show and how to make it appear.

Loading states are skeletons matching the final layout, not spinners.

The whole console is responsive; tables scroll horizontally inside their own container rather than breaking the page.

Every score is accompanied by its severity label — colour alone must never be the only carrier of meaning.

Timestamps show absolute time on hover, relative in the label.

The footer provenance strip is a real feature, not decoration: it proves the numbers are reproducible (engine version + knowledge base hash + scoring model version).

Build the full console with realistic mock data across all pages. Make it look like a product a security team would pay for.

About the attached reference image: follow it closely — layout, density, card composition, the per-dimension row with delta and sparkline, the attack-chain node diagram, the services table, and the score-scale legend. It gets the risk semantics right: higher = worse, rising risk in red, N/A · Não avaliado as a neutral state.

Two adjustments: (a) three dimensions must render as not_assessed — Secrets, Software & Patch Intelligence and Platform Hardening — the image shows only two; (b) the sixth dimension is Configuration Security, which is the primary assessed one, as shown.
